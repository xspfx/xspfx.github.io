While digital spaces were once seen as a promise of democratic discourse, free exchange of knowledge, and global understanding, they have also become havens of hate, intolerance, and anti-democratic thinking. In the echo chambers of the so-called *Manosphere*, the *Alt-Right*, and other neo-fascist movements, a new, digitally fueled reaction is growing against the achievements of the Enlightenment, against feminism, human rights, and equality.",
